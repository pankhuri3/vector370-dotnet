.Net REST client for Vector 370

Examples Folder Organization:

The "Setup" folder contains example code on how to perform the intial setup of items.  These items are things that
usually only need to be done once.  For example, you only need to create a keyword once, after it is created you may
attach (dettach) it as much as you'd like.

The "Common" folder provides examples on things you would do multiple times.  Such as pushing a campaign, searching
for a contact or attaching/detaching a keyword to/from a campaign.

Note that these examples will NOT run as is.  You must provide login information their App.Config file and supply some
values to channels and keyword IDs that you have access to.
