TODO: Have this file prof read by a non-techie.

This framework provides a basic RestRepository class in which some repository like patterns can be applied to the
3Seventy APIs.  Note that this system does not provide the full functionality one might expect to find with
frameworks such as Entity.  It is intended mostly as a convenience framework.

That being said, an effort was made such that one should be able to easily pull the models and enumerations out of 
this framework and wrap them into whatever system if they wish to do so.

Note that additional information on how to call the 3Seventy APIs can be found at:
http://api.3seventy.com/docs/

TODO: Fix the above URL so that it is not version dependent!
